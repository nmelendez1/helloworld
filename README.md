# helloworld
Hello, my name is Nathaniel and I am completing the "helloworld" lab for GIS4102C at the University of Florida. 

# project description
I created a github repository to understand the many ins and outs of version control. 

# files in the repository
- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the "Hello World" webpage. It contains the structure and content of the webpage. 
- `README.md`: This file, providing details about the project and the learning process.

## View the Webpage You can view the webpage I created at `https://nmelendez1.github.io/helloworld/

Thank you for checking out my first Github project! :)
